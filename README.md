# A02 - GitHub Tutorial

This README is a github tutortial and will cover the basics of creating repositories, editing files, and saving changes with **commit**s

##0) 
1) Go to GitHub.com and create an account. Take the steps necessary to create an account such as verifying email address 

##1) Create a github
1: Click New **repository**
2: Set the **repository** name to A02 (A should be capital because it matters)
3: Choose public for easy viewing 
4: Turn on Add a README file
5: Click create **repository** 

##2)

2: Click on README.md
3: Click the pencil icon to edit the file

5: Look for the **commit**t changes button. Add a short message like "updating README". A **commit** is simply a saved checkpoint for your project.

2: Open a terminal and run: 
  **git****clone** <past_link_here>
3: Enter the folder: 
  cd A02

1: **commit**s - saved versions of your work
2: **Branches** - a seperate line or **branch**of development that allows you to isolate changes without affecting the main project (good for experimenting)
3: **merge** - combining changes from one **branch**into another
4: **merge conflict** - happens when you **merge** **branches** that have competing **commit**s. **git**needs help which changes to include in the final **merge**
5: **Pull** Requests - a GitHub feature that allows one to propose changes, usually from a branch, and allows review before merging
6: **Remote** - online version of your **repository** (on Github) 
7: **Fetch** - Downloads new changes from the **remote**
8: **Pull** - does a **fetch** + **merge** to bring changes into your current
